## Apsim FiFa 2022 Prediction 

This repo contains a streamlit web app that displays matches that were happening during the world cup. Each team leader at Apsim inputted their prediction score for each match on a daily basis. The inputs were then stored in google spreadsheet. Using an evaluation logic, the result for each team and its match was stored in a dataframe. Following which, an aggregation of scores per team was used to determine which team was leading.
